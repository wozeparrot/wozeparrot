## Currently Used Things

### [NixOS](https://nixos.org/)

Current OS, runs on my servers and personal computers. Maybe even mobile devices soon.

*dotfiles soon...*

The nix package manager is used in all of my projects to provide reproducible builds and reproducible development environments.

### [zig](https://ziglang.org/)

Language of choice for pretty much everything.

### [rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/)

Language of choice for primarily desktop applications.

## Projects that I think are cool!

- ### [wozey.service](https://github.com/wozeparrot/wozey.service)
  - A opinionated Discord bot.
  - Written in lua with a splash of python for that juicy *AI*.
  - A modular framework that allows easy creation of new functionality.
  - A builtin AI chatbot that leverages multiple AI models.
  - Easy deployment with nix on NixOS based systems.
- ### [endron](https://github.com/enqy/endron)
  - A statically-typed programming language that compiles to everything.
  - Future redesign in progress as a more hardware focused language.
- ### [enmity44](https://github.com/enqy/enmity44)
  - Minimal, wireless 44-key split keyboard.
  - Effortlessly portable with absolutely no bells or whistles.
- ### [entropy](https://github.com/wozeparrot/entropy)
  - A experience development framework using [nelua](https://nelua.io), a lua-like language that compiles to c.
  - Leverages the nix build system heavily to support cross compilation and easy dependecy management.
  - Utilizes next generation WebGPU for accelerated rendering.
- ### [wbot](https://github.com/wozeparrot/wbot)
  - Highly experimental bindings of [wpilib](https://github.com/wpilibsuite/allwpilib) to the [wren](https://wren.io/) programming language.
  - Utilizes c++ just for bindings to native and vendor specific functions.
  - Better reimplementations of many wpilib functions in wren such as the command framework and scheduler.
  - Real world testing on [Team 4308's](https://github.com/Team4308/) 2022 robot.
- ### [skyror](https://github.com/enqy/skyror)
  - An accelerator oriented instruction set.
  - Vector oriented.
  - Mostly RISC.
- ### [raymarcher2](https://github.com/wozeparrot/raymarcher2)
  - Uses glsl compiled to SPIR-V shaders that runs on a python based host program using vulkan.
  - Implements a full raymarching pipeline with reflections and accurate light simulation.
  - Contains 4 demo scenes in glsl and 1 demo scene using a python based DSL.
- ### [hoshihoshi](https://github.com/wozeparrot/hoshihoshi)
  - A fully open source virtual avatar motion capture system using your webcam.
  - Written in python with html/js for the frontend.
  - Utilizes the high performance [mediapipe](https://github.com/google/mediapipe/) library from Google to provide face mesh data.
  - Implements multiple filters on top of raw face mesh data to ensure accurate tracking.
  - Simplified build and dependencies with nix.
